# Specification Quality Checklist: Phase I Core Todo Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

**Details**:
- All mandatory sections completed with comprehensive content
- Five user stories with clear priorities (P1, P2, P3)
- 18 functional requirements, all testable and unambiguous
- 10 measurable success criteria, all technology-agnostic
- Comprehensive edge cases identified
- Clear CLI interaction flows documented
- Error handling scenarios fully defined
- Out of scope items explicitly listed
- Definition of done clearly stated
- No implementation details present
- Constraints, assumptions, and key entities documented

**No clarifications needed**: All requirements are clear and unambiguous with reasonable defaults applied.
